Periodic Thread Abstraction Test

This test consists in creating three periodic threads as follows:
  Thread 1 prints "a" every 100 ms;
  Thread 2 prints "b" every 200 ms;
  Thread 3 prints "c" every 400 ms.
Threads have been created. I'll wait for them to finish...

Thread A exited with status 65, thread B exited with status 66 and thread C exit
ed with status 67.

The estimated time to run the test was 4000 ms. The measured time was 4012 ms!
I'm also done, bye!
